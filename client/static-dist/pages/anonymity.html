          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>The application is made of the 3 key components: a widget that can be injected
            into almost any web page, a back-end service that handles data collection and a
            dashboards service that does the data analytics and reporting.
          </p>

          <p>When a person navigates to an intranet page with the widget for the first time,
            a person will be asked to configure it by selecting the team.
            That configuration is stored locally in a form of a browser cookie.
            If configuration is available, the widget will display the vote options and
            given a mood vote will disappear for a day. The mood vote will be sent to the
            back-end in an anonymous and pseudo-encrypted form.
          </p>

          <p>The pseudo-encryption mechanism makes an option-vote code time dependent, so a
            code that meant "happy" today will mean "unhappy" tomorrow, and also what means
            happy for one user may mean unhappy making the code interception a costly job
            a modern organization shouldn't allow that anyway.
          </p>

          <p>The back-end will digest the vote-code and append it (as +1) to one of the vote
            option counters. In this way it is impossible to identify an individual behind
            the vote by looking at the stored data.
          </p>

          <h3>Try it yourself!</h3>
          You may see the data that the App sends when you vote. Try voting with the same mood for 2 days and compare the transmitted messages. You may see what's transmitted by doing the following:
          <ul>
            <li>While on the App home page, press F12 (if you are using IE, otherwise Ctrl+Shift+I)</li>
            <li>Make vote</li>
            <li>make a snip of the data transmitted (like below):<br>
              <a href="http://placehold.it"><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150"></a></li>
            <li>do the same operation next time you can vote and compare the snips</li>
          </ul>

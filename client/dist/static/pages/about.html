          <h2>What is it?</h2>
          <p>This App helps to anonymously collect the measure of happiness
            and the reasons for unhappiness among employees.</p>

          <p>People's mood at work is influenced by a variety of things like work-related
            success or fail stories, level of load, communication issues, it, etc. This
            tool will help to capture and track the mood/happiness dynamics in a team
            providing a bird-eye view so that a leadership team could reflect on its own
            performance but also help the teams in trouble by various means
            (e.g. balance load).
          </p>

          <h2>Lottery feature</h2>
          <p>The application provides means to promote the participation and increase the
            general happiness buy giving out an individual within a team or group of teams
            a bonus voucher code, that can be exchanged for a gift. The application also
            implements basic means to prevent voucher mining. For instance, a team will
            be banned from the participation if a number of votes per day exceeds the
            expectation. This feature will be available shortly.
